## About myself
I am a 5th grade student in the Robotica y Sistemas Digitales degree taught by Tecnologico de Monterrey in Mexico City campus. 
I am interested in the fields of computer physics in the part of fluid physics. But my main interest is in biomechanics to apply robotics in medical applications and help people to gain back mobility.

## Projects
